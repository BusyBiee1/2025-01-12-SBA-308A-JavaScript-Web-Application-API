/StockAPI-Alphavantage (master)


Read me:
This applicaiton uses AlphaVantage API to get 10 most popular stocks. 
The user can buy and sell these stocks (but only 1 qty at a time) from the app
Their activity of buy and sell is displayed as if it was excuted by calling the Placeholder API

This alphavantage api allows only 25 calls per day!
